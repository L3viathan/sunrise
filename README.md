#Sunrise
##Wake up to important information, read to you

Sunrise is a small set of scripts that reads things for me. Everyone but me will have to adapt it, probably heavily, to be able to make use of it.

##Usage
- Set a CLI audio player (such as qtplay) in sunrise.sh
- add a call to checkheute.sh to your crontab, I let it check every minute
